This project targets ESP32-C3 Super Mini, communicating with a DMT48270C43 touchscreen via UART. ESP32 connects to WiFi and sends HTTP requests to a Powersoft Mezzo 604 A device. Example code should include UART handling, WiFi connection, and HTTP client requests. All code should use the Arduino framework (C++).
